Dear All,

Finally the moment has arrived to say “see you again”!!!!

On 13th October 2011, I walked into Fidelity Campus for the first time...from then till date…I was part of Fidelity family! (4 years 6 months 2 days) which is never easy, especially when you have been part of the Fidelity family for these many years. It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every moment and I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with each of you with whom I have interacted.

I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for all your guidance and support. I have spent some of the best days of my life here. It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every moment. I appreciate having had the opportunity to work with and know each of you.

Sincere thanks to all my Leads, Project Managers, Directors and VP's in India and in Onshore for their wonderful phenomenal support, recognition, guidelines & encouragement during these days and My colleagues (offshore and onshore) for their support and guidance to excel in my career. 

I take back all the good memories(Whoopee Cricket, FPL, Info fest, WI-Offsite, Team dinner, Team outings, cycling, Birthday celebrations and lots more) which shall be cherished by me throughout my life.

It was a pleasure knowing each and every one of you. In case I have unintentionally hurt anyone, please forgive me. Needless to say, please stay in touch.

This is not a goodbye, only “hasta luego” or “see you later”.

Thanks for making me smile for some time in my life.

Please do drop in a note with your personal contacts to my mail id.

Good luck and wish you all the best in your endeavors!
