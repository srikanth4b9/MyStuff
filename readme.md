1. MV* JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS
These help you organize code. Two of the most popular being backbone.js and angular.js. 

1.2 Unit Testing -> Jasmine and Karma help developers write tests for applications. 

2. CSS TOOLS
Compared to frameworks and unit testing above, the following CSS tools are fairly easy to learn.

2.1 Precompilers -> Using a precompiler (or preprocessor) has a lot of advantages, from making code cleaner and maintaining organization. Popular CSS precompilers are as Sass, Less, and Stylus. Only learn one. Will suggests Sass.

2.2 CSS frameworks -> These help optimize your workflow with built-in grids and other CSS components. Two popular examples are Bootstrap and Foundation.

2.3 Responsive design -> Responsive design means being able to build sites that work on all screen sizes — desktop, tablet and mobile. Responsive design is intrinsic to frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation. Meaning if you learn one, you’re good to go.

3. FRONT END BUILD TOOLS
These relate to file size optimization and workflow efficiency.

3.1 Package Management ->This is Bower. When projects get large, it can be tough organizing all the libraries, assets, and so forth. Bower helps with managing all the parts.

3.2 Yeoman.io -> Helps get you started quickly with projects, encourages you to adopt best practices. Run in the command line.

3.3 Task Runners -> like Grunt or Gulp. They run on the command line and compress files. Also act as a compiler for Sass or Less. They also have a wide range of plugins boasting other features.

3.4 Javascript Module Loader -> Like Require.js and Browserify — these bundle up dependencies.
